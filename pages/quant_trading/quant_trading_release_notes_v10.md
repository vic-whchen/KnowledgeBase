## Overview

> **Quantitative trading** consists of **trading** strategies based on **quantitative** analysis, which rely on mathematical computations and number crunching to identify trading opportunities. As quantitative trading is generally used by financial institutions and hedge funds, the transactions are usually large in size and may involve the purchase and sale of hundreds of thousands of shares and other securities. However, quantitative trading is becoming more commonly used by individual investors. [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-trading.asp)

In this first release, I will give a brief introduction to **Quant Trading Systems**. Some of the common API implementations and best open source trading systems both in China and from overseas will be presented here. I will mainly discuss about their API implementations, and practical usages. The goal is to grab a rough idea on how to develop a quant trading system. Basic knowledge about financial engineering might be covered as well.
